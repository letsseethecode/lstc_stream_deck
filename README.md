## Install

Installing the pre-requisites

```
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo install ravedude
```

Creating a Rust project

```
cargo generate --git https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal-template.git
```

## Running

Plug the arduino into your USB port and run it as follows:

Automatically detect the USB port:

```
cargo run
```

or to specify the port you can use:

```
RAVEDUDE_PORT=/dev/<usb_port> cargo run
```

## Software Design

No idea.  Figure it out. :D
